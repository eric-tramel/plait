"""Feedback types for the optimization system.

This module provides the FeedbackType enum and Feedback dataclass which
represent evaluation results from loss functions. Feedback objects can
propagate backward through the computation graph to accumulate improvement
suggestions into Parameters.

The API mirrors PyTorch's loss.backward() pattern:
    >>> feedback = await loss_fn(output, target, record=record)
    >>> await feedback.backward()  # Propagates feedback to Parameters

Example:
    >>> from inf_engine.optimization.feedback import Feedback, FeedbackType
    >>>
    >>> # Create feedback from evaluation
    >>> feedback = Feedback(
    ...     content="Response was too verbose",
    ...     score=0.6,
    ...     feedback_type=FeedbackType.LLM_JUDGE,
    ... )
    >>> str(feedback)
    '[0.60] Response was too verbose'

    improvement suggestions into Parameters.

    Attributes:
        content: The feedback text describing what was good or bad about
            the output and how it could be improved.
        score: Optional numeric score normalized to 0-1 range, where 1.0
            indicates perfect output and 0.0 indicates complete failure.

            to HUMAN if not specified.
        metadata: Optional dictionary for storing additional information
            such as raw scores, criteria used, or evaluation context.
